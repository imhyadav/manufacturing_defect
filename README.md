# 🚀 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to help manufacturing and quality teams understand defect trends and improve production quality through data-driven insights.
Using Python and Google Colab, this project enables:

Identification of frequently occurring defect types

Analysis of defect distribution across machines and processes

Detection of patterns impacting manufacturing quality

Support for operational and quality improvement decisions

---

# 📊 Key Analysis Areas

Defect frequency analysis

Machine-wise and process-wise defect comparison

Missing value and data consistency checks

---

# 📈 Key Insights (Sample)

Certain defect types contribute to a large share of total defects

A few machines/processes are responsible for higher defect rates

Data preprocessing was crucial to handle missing and inconsistent values

Visual analysis highlights priority areas for quality improvement
